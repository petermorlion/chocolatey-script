# New PC Install Script
Script to install apps on new PC.

## Steps

I ran most of these as Admin, but don't think it's necessary.

- Activate WSL
- `Unblock-File .\script.ps1`
- Run `script.ps1`
- Install manually (if necessary):
  - Visual Studio
  - LLBLGen
  - FileZilla
  - FlyWay
- Modify bashrc for Git Bash and WSL
